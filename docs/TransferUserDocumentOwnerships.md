# TransferUserDocumentOwnerships API

Transfers document ownerships from one user to another. All documents owned by the source user are reassigned to the target user.

> **A transfer to the same user is accepted... no longer.** `fromUserName` and `toUserName` may
> not name one account: the call is refused with `4000`, because moving everything away from an
> account and handing it to nobody is not a transfer. It used to be accepted and reported as a
> success.

## JavaScript

Every call answers XML with HTTP 200, success or not, so `success` is the thing to branch on and
`errorCode` is the number to report.

```javascript
async function call(action, params) {
  const response = await fetch(`/srv.asmx/${action}?${new URLSearchParams(params)}`);
  const root = new DOMParser()
    .parseFromString(await response.text(), 'text/xml')
    .documentElement;

  if (root.getAttribute('success') !== 'true') {
    throw new Error(`${root.getAttribute('errorCode')}: ${root.getAttribute('error')}`);
  }
  return root;
}
```

Moves the documents one user owns to another user.

```javascript
const root = await call('TransferUserDocumentOwnerships', {
  authenticationTicket: ticket,
  fromUserName: 'jsmith',
  toUserName: 'agarcia',
});

// There is no errorCode here - branch on success, and read the optional warnings attribute.
const warnings = root.getAttribute('warnings');
```

An answer may carry a `warnings` attribute when some of the document ownerships could not be moved - a conflict at
the destination, most often. It is absent when everything moved.

This is one of the calls to make before [DeleteUser](DeleteUser.md): what the account holds does
not go with it.

## Notes

- Reassigns the ownership of all documents where `fromUserName` is currently the owner.
- The response root element is `<root>`, not `<response>`.
- Typically used as part of a user offboarding process before deleting the source user.

## Error Codes

The `errorCode` values this operation returns, checked against a running server:

| `errorCode` | When |
|---:|---|
| `4010` | the ticket is expired or unknown |
| `4030` | there is no ticket at all |
| `4041` | no user by either name |
| `4000` | `fromUserName` and `toUserName` name the same account |
| `HTTP 400` | `fromUserName` or `toUserName` was empty; refused by model binding, so there is no error document |

Every answer carries an `errorCode` now, including a `0` on success. The family used to write
none at all, so `success` was the only thing a client could branch on.
